In the woods I go
Its silent harmony calls
Wind pushes me in

Darkness guides me there
Black mist haunts the restful lake
My hoarse throat struggles

A corpse floats by me
The fish looks into the void
On its back, it cries

The stubs stand alone
Their champions are gone now
The missing green haunts

The black blood oozes
Natura does not weep, ever
But I weep for it
