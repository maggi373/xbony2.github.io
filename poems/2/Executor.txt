You are the executor, and I am the ex-cute.
If I ask you to spare me, will you?
If I beg, will you?
If I plead with my body, will you?
Probably not.
You are the executor, and I am the ex-cute.
And you have to do what you have to do.
So to be fair to you, I won't ask these questions.
But don't complain how you hurt when it's my head that rolls off.
