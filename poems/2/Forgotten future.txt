One day...
I wear something decent.
I carry flowers.
Candy? Eh, maybe.
I knock on your door.
You come out.
We hug.
We kiss quickly.
I give you my gifts.
We smile at each other, and cry.
Tears of joy.
Tears of love.
True love.

Now that future is shattered.
Tears are there, but not of joy.
Just if I could have that future back...
Can I replace your face with another's?
Or maybe it's not too late...
If I came anyway, would you accept me as your lover?
But alas, I think this future is too far away to be my future...
