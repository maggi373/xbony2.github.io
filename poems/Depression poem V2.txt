My knife’s gone dull;
But I still feel the hull
of this damned living hell.

The lemons I’ve been given
aren’t enough for lemonade.
But for no one I’ve striven.

Life’s all just so unfair;
I’ve ripped out all my hair.
It hurts, but it hurts far less.

Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.
Blood doesn’t make me feel sick.
I’ve seen it many times before.

Parents hid the ropes,
so cut’s the only way.
Or I could try eating soaps.

Parents try to love me,
but I don’t care.
It’s so strong, the debris.

Life is like an unfair game;
doesn’t matter how many times you play.
It always ends the same.

With the drip, drip, drip.
The scream of the knife.
My life is a train off it’s tracks.
I’m ending it now. Drip.
After a while you get dizzy,
and everything turns black.
