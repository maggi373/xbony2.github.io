At this point I guess my poetry has become rambling.
But isn't the best poetry the ones that connects with feelings?
My life will someday be nothing but a ramble.
Me rambling to those that will hear.
About my life, and what I should have done.
And what you should have done.
But will it all end crying over what went wrong?
Or will it all end crying, in tears of joy, what went right?
