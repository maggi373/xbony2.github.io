I scavenge the bones with the markings on them.
The fragmented pieces.
I try to make what I can from it.
It's not the full thing, but it's what I got.
An outburst of emotion brings poetry, but memory doesn't keep it that well.
So, sorry, sorry me, for not writing when I felt, and insulting my own poetry for that reason.
Yeah.
