You didn't say hi later today, but I'm sure you saw me.
You're trying to avoid me, but to be fair I'm trying to avoid you.
But not me, and not you.
The pain in our hearts we try to avoid.
Your guilt, and my love.
Or maybe it's your love and my guilt.
For how long will it hurt?
Probably not forever.
But maybe it feels like that.
I accept your sorries and say sorry.
