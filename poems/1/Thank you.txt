I still love you, by the way.
We had so many good times together.
Human nature makes the bad ones so much more memorable to us.
And twist the good memories.
So anyway, thank you for the good times.
I wish I thanked you when they were good.
I wish we could have more good memories together.
But alas.
Oh, and sorry for the bad times.
