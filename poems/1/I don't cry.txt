I remember when you really wanted me, even though I didn't really want you.
I remember when I really wanted you, even though you didn't really want me.
I didn't cry.

I remember when you told me you loved my voice and thought it was perfect.
I remember when I wanted to swallow a small knife so no one would ever hear it again.
I didn't cry.

I remember when you told me you liked my face.
I don't.
And I don't cry.
