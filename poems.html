<p class="title">Poems</p>
<p>So uh, this is a collection of poems I've made. Some are depressing, some are personal, and some are just straight-up bad so be warned. In order of when I made them.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="poems/Depression poem V2.txt">Depression poem</a>. Trigger warning: this is graphical/suicidal. But uh, I made this in <i>middle school</i>! (2014) (for an English project, I was okay, I promise. I can't believe my teacher didn't try to talk to me about it other than saying it was great.) Although it's slightly revised (mostly grammar) it's really good. Original <a href="poems/Depression poem.txt">here</a>. Sorry if unicode is borked.</li>
	<li><a href="poems/Destruction of us.txt">Destruction of us</a>, a set of 5 Haikus. For an English project. Finalized on May 1st, 2017. Kind of environmentalist, and not too bad.</li>
	<li>Break-up sets. After my boyfriend left me on May 1st, and replaced me about a week later, I made these. He liked to make poems when he was depressed and I guess I took after him.
