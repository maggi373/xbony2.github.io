		<p>Checkout my amazing blog! :D It's like it's 1990! I don't need special software, I'm not a scrub!</p>
		<p>Anyhow, I made this "post" to count the number of mods. There are a lot of mods- 
			<a href="http://openeye.openmods.info/all">OpenEye</a> lists more then 11,000. But this isn't even all of the mods- some are excluded 
			because they use the same mod ID, and *many* are excluded because they were made for version under 1.6. Plus, not everyone use OpenEye, so 
			there's pleanty of mods that overlooked because very few people play them. For example, I couldn't find the 
			<a href="http://www.planetminecraft.com/mod/mexican-cuisine-mod-alpha-testers-needed/">Mexican Cuisine Mod</a> on OpenEye (don't quote 
			me when it is added though). Lastly, OpenEye doesn't count non-Forge mods, which there are many of, even today. 
			Anyway, the point is the OpenEye mod count is probably off by a lot- I'd say most people don't use OpenEye, shame that it isn't in the 
			big modpacks. But people do though, or it's data wouldn't exist, and the #OpenEye IRC channel wouldn't report a new crash every quarter 
			minute (which is a lot of crashes, btw).</p>
		<p>Anyway, I predict there has been 50,000 mods over time. This is a complete guess, and hopefully not a bad one. I don't have any proof, and I
		didn't come up with an advanced algorithm to determine it. It's just an estimate.</p>
		<p>Lets talk real numbers: the Minecraft Forums has almost 25,000 pages in their mod section. CurseForge has about 3400 mods. PlanetMinecraft
		has 7364 mods (exact number as of the time of this writing). Searching "Minecraft" on Github results with 30,090 repositories, although many 
		(or even most) of those aren't mods. (searching "Minecraft mod" yields 5778 entries). Googling "minecraft mods" yields 48,200,000 results.</p>
